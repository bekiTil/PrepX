        Whenever you look at someone's pupil, you are in fact looking through a
        hole and at their retina. Because the cavity of the eye acts like a dark
        cave that absorbs most of the light, the red color of the retina usually
        looks black under normal lighting conditions. But if the light gets
        bright enough, the redness of the retina becomes more obvious. The flash
        of light from a camera is bright enough and angled properly to make the
        eye's redness more apparent. The result is the all-too-familiar red-eye
        in photographs. But the camera's flash is doing nothing more special
        than providing extra light. In fact, you can see the redness of the
        human retina without a flash or camera. Place a friend close to a
        regular light bulb such that he is facing the light blub. Now place
        yourself between the bulb and your friend such that the top of your
        shadow sits just below his eyes. Now look at his eyes and his pupils
        will be bright red. For this to work right, the light must be bright and
        localized (such as a single 100W incandescent light bulb; not a flood
        light, a shaded light, or a collection of bulbs), other lights must be
        turned off or blocked (including sunlight), and your friend's pupils
        need to be widely dilated. You can get his pupils to dilate by turning
        all lights off for a minute or having him close and cover his eyes for a
        minute. Upon opening his eyes with the light on, there will be a brief
        moment before his pupils constrict when you can best see the red eye. If
        you don't see a very dark, crisp shadow of your head just below his
        eyes, then the lighting configuration has not been set up properly.
